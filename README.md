You: Use Netlify CLI instead
AI: Updated preferences to use Netlify CLI method.

You: Deploy now
AI: Starting deployment... [Progress tracking and live logs appear]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Common Issues

1. **"No OpenAI API key found"**
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file

2. **"Command not found: netlify/vercel"**
   - Install the respective CLI tools globally

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Run `netlify login` or `vercel login` to authenticate

4. **Preview not showing**
   - Some platforms block iframe embedding; use the external link button
